# Power-BI-Project
This project is part of my Data Analysis Portfolio.

## Objective
This project is about cleaning, standardizing and analysing a dataset released by police department from the city of Curitiba, PR - Brazil.
The dataset is about all the felony complaints made by the police in 2024.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Duplicates, special characters, useless collumns and blanc lines were removed from the dataset.

2. **Standardization**:
   - Data types were fixed for some collumns.

4. **Data Corrections**:
   - Many incorrect districts names were found and were corrected
   - Some other datas were from others cities and had to be removed.
      
5. **Final Steps**:
   - After cleaning, reparing and organizing dataset, some charts were created to vizualise the results which made easier to analyse the data as a whole.

## Technologies Used
